<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>
Figure out what you want to measure.  For example:
<ul>
<li>determine power consumption of various devices/circuites
<li>identify vampire devices
<li>correlate power consumption with temperatures
<li>correlate power consumption with occupancy
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Create a map of the system.  Identify and label each circuit.
</p>
<p>
Be consistent with the wiring to ensure correct polarity.  Polarity is determined by a number of things:
<ul>
<li>location of load relative to breaker
<li>single leg 110V circuit vs two legs of 220V circuit
<li>orientation of the CT
<li>location of CT leads
<li>polarity setting within the GEM
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Determine how much data you need to store.  Determine how much data you can store.

btmon works only with Python 2, not Python 3.

- create a map.  circuit/channel/label

- label the wires

- polarity.  be consistent with wiring.  options to change polarity later - geometry, leads, gem polarity setting per channel, btmon

- figure out what you want to measure.  here are typical scenarios:
 - power on major energy consumers
 - vampire devices
 - exterior temperature, interior temperature, heat/cool equipment power, tstat

- how much data can you store?

- decide on a configuration.  here are a few typical:
 - router that uploads to servers
 - everything on a router (asus n16 running tomato with an external hd)
 - everything on a dedicated computer (nimbus with flash drive)
 - view on cell phone, tablet, computer

developer issues

- counter wraparound
- counter reset
- polarity
- differential versus cumulative calculations
- what to store (diff vs cumulative)
- how often to sample, how many samples to store, how often to upload
- ability to read all settings, change all settings
